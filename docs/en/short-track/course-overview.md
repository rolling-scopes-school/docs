## ðŸŽ¯ Goals of the Qualifying Stage

The Qualifying Stage is designed for students who are motivated to build a career in IT and are interested in pathways that may lead to opportunities at **EPAM**. Its purpose is to confirm your technical foundation (Markdown, HTML/CSS, TypeScript/JavaScript/Git) and readiness for advanced training. Successful participants will move on to the **Short Track (\~3.5 months)**, which provides React or Angular practice, team project experience, and prepares you to be considered for recommendations to **EPAM and other companies**. More than **1000 RS School graduates have started their careers at EPAM**, and around **24% of RS School mentors are EPAM employees**.
