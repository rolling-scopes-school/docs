### How do I register for a course in the RS App?

You can register for upcoming courses [here](https://app.rs.school/registry/student).

### How can I tell that I have successfully registered for the course?

Go to [RS App](https://app.rs.school/) and check that the course you want is displayed in the list of courses.
Then open the Score tab. If you see your name in the first row of the table, congratulations, you have successfully registered for the course.

### How can I find out if I can register for a course that has already started?

If you can select the desired course from the list of courses on the registration page (<https://app.rs.school/registry/student>), it means that you can still enrol in it.

### How can I leave a course in the RS App?

To leave the course, click on the "Leave course" button in [your profile](https://app.rs.school/profile). The course itself will remain in your list of courses, but you will no longer be able to complete assignments or track your statistics.

**Attention!** Clicking this button excludes the student, but allows them to rejoin the course independently by clicking the "Back to Course" button.

#### My Total on the Score page did not update after submitting the test. What should I do?

Total is updated once a day at 04:00 GMT+3.
