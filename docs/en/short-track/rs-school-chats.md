3. Discord allows you to collapse and mute all channels in a category.
4. Each channel in a category has a channel topic containing information about the channel.

- **#announcements** - This channel contains the most important and relevant information. All announcements, as well as any important comments on the learning process, class transfers, and new assignments are posted in this channel.

This can be done in the channel settings.
