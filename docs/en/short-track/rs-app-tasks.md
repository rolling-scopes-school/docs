# Submitting assignments in the RS App

All assignments must be submitted in the RS App **before the deadline**:

- Auto-testable tasks are submitted on the `Auto-Test` page. These tasks include: tests, algorithmic tasks, codewars tasks, and some tasks designed for automatic checking(for example CV-markdown)
- In the case of a Cross-Check assignment, you must submit the required link on the Cross-check: Submit page before the deadline. After submitting the link, you can continue working on the assignment until the deadline. You can submit the link several times â€” the last one will be saved. Anyone who does not submit their work on time will receive a score of 0.

## Tests

- Tests for theoretical modules can be found in the `Auto-Test` tab in [RS App](https://app.rs.school/).
- The test has a minimum passing score, which is specified in the description for each test (usually 70% of the maximum possible score).
- You may take the test the number of times specified in the description. The last result will be counted.
- Also (if specified), you can take the test more than once, but the test score will be reduced by half.
- The test results will be displayed immediately. They will be added to `Score` after the statistics are updated (at 04:00 GMT+3).

#### Will it be possible to re-submit automatically checked tasks?

You may do so as many times as you wish, but before the deadline.

## Cross-check

## FAQ

### Is it acceptable to obtain solutions to tasks from the internet?

It is acceptable to take ideas from all possible sources, but not solutions.

### When can you submit a link for cross-checking?

We recommend submitting the link as early as possible. You can complete a small part of the assignment, submit the link, and then continue working on the assignment until the deadline.
