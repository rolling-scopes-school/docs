## RS School Certificate

At students’ request, we do not issue certificates on a massive scale and set a threshold for each course.

Usually the passing score equals to 70% of the best result in the course. For example, the best student scores 1884 points, 0.70 \* 1884 ~ = 1318. Thus, the passing score is 1318

### Minimum requirements for obtaining a certificate

- Total passing score – 70% of the top score
