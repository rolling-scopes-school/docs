#### Some features of filling out the schedule

- Main fields in events/assignments change immediately **in all courses**. For example, **Name**, **Type**, **Url**.

- The **Special** field allows you to additionally specify the type of event/assignment. For example, make it optional using the _optional_ tag. It's allowed to add tags not only from the provided list.
