## Objectives of the interview:

After conducting all the interviews, the mentor can expel part of the group in order to keep the number of students he can mentor. At his request, the mentor may postpone the deduction for several weeks in order to make a more informed decision.

- Students gaining experience in interviews.
 
#### Students receive an invitation in the following order:

-	According to the recommendation of the mentor, if the mentor himself is ready to mentor these students
-	According to the results of training in the first stage of the course

#### Interview process:

Interviews take place during the first two weeks of RS School stage # 2. A list of student-mentor pairs will be available at http://app.rs.school.
	Students themselves contact the mentor and agree on the date of the interview. Mentor contacts will be available at http://app.rs.school.
	Interviews can be conducted online.
	Format: We strongly recommend conducting interviews with the camera turned on. This helps establish contact and reduces the risk of cheating.

#### English requirements for stage # 2:

English proficiency is not a strict requirement for training in stage # 2. While fluency is not necessary, most course materials and tests are in English, so a basic understanding will be helpful. If you plan to apply for a job at EPAM, you should aim for at least B1 level by the end of stage # 2.

#### What should a student do in case of an unsuccessful interview:

The student can continue their studies on their own or sign up for the next set. Lectures, assignments and chats are in the public domain. Assignments will not be monitored by a mentor.

#### What to do if a student is not satisfied with an interview with a mentor:

In this case, the student needs to describe the situation and his claim to the feedback form - https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeN-OYDhazcs7WhZi_oae-u8bCLuVcsksCeZkYcfRMMwj3eJA/viewform
