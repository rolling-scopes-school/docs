## Action Algorithm "What to do if something doesn't work in RS APP?"

1. First check if someone has already described this problem in [rsschool-app](https://github.com/rolling-scopes/rsschool-app/issues). If the problem is described, you just need to leave a comment in the corresponding issue stating that the problem is relevant for you as well. If there's no similar problem, proceed to step 2.
2. Ask about the problem in the corresponding Discord channel (all assignments have their own channel). Wait for responses from other students/activists. If the problem is not solved, proceed to step 3.
3. Ask about the problem in the **#questions-to-rsapp** Discord channel. Wait for comments from activists/admins. If the problem is not solved, proceed to step 4.
4. Create a new issue with a description of the problem in the [rsschool-app](https://github.com/rolling-scopes/rsschool-app/issues) repository

## Typical Problems and Their Solutions

1. No access to the course, **"No access"** error

   **Solution:** register for the desired course using [this link](https://app.rs.school/registry/student)

2. I don't know how to see my errors in an automatically checked assignment (**Auto-test**)

   **Solution:** go to [app.rs.school](https://app.rs.school) and go to the **Auto-test** section, select the desired assignment. Verification details will be displayed in the **Details** column:
