# Mentoring
Mentoring begins after conducting Technical screening, as a result of which the mentor forms a group of 2-6 students.

During the first week of mentoring, the mentor needs to:
- Create a communication channel with their students (in Discord, Telegram, etc.)
- Schedule a weekly meeting with their students
- Familiarize themselves with the rules of interaction between students and mentors
- Read the [algorithm for reviewing student PRs](pull-request-review-process.md)
- Bookmark the curriculum - [stage#2](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/tree/master/stage2)

### Basic Rules of Interaction Between Students and Mentors
- Communication is initiated by the student. The student must be self-motivated to learn.
- Completed student work must be reviewed by the mentor within one to two weeks.
- Review of completed work is done through review of corresponding Pull Requests. [Algorithm for reviewing student PRs](pull-request-review-process.md)
- Most questions students ask in corresponding Discord channels, not their mentor. [More about Discord channel organization](rs-school-chats.md).

### Weekly Meeting with Students
- Can be conducted with all students at once or in 1-on-1 format.
- Can be conducted online (Skype, Google Hangouts, etc.) or offline.
- Standard meeting duration is 60 - 90 minutes
- The meeting must be added to your calendar and students' calendars.
- Before the meeting, you need to review open Pull Requests from students. Leave your comments. Each PR should have at least three of your comments.
- Example meeting plan:
  - Introduction, discussion of news.
  - Discussion of topics, curriculum modules. 
  - Discussion of Code review results.
  - Additional topics. For example:
      - resume/self-presentation preparation and interview process
      - framework choice - React/Angular/etc
      - scrum, patterns, etc.
  - Answering student questions 

### Weekly Mentor Activities
- Mentor reviews and evaluates student work through review of corresponding student Pull Requests. As a result, each student's PR contains mentor comments on the code, recommendations, and a final grade. Each PR should have at least three of your comments. The grade is set by the mentor based on the evaluation criteria specified for each assignment. After review, the mentor enters the grade into the Score form, based on which the Public Score is generated. [Algorithm for reviewing student PRs](pull-request-review-process.md)
- Conducting meetings, answering student questions.
- If the mentor has fewer than two students or the mentor is ready to take more, they can pick up students from the Waitlist.

### Deadlines for Students
- Deadlines for all tasks are indicated in the course schedule.
- If a student didn't submit an assignment on time, the mentor can, at their discretion, apply the following penalties:
    - -10 points to the grade for delays up to 3 days inclusive
    - -30% to the grade for delays up to 7 days inclusive
    - -70% to the grade for delays more than a week
    - at the mentor's discretion, if there's a valid reason (hospital, military training, etc.)
    - When applying penalty coefficients, rounding is done in favor of the student

### Deadlines for Mentors 
It's expected that the mentor reviews the student's work within one to two weeks after the student submits the work. But the sooner, the better. Student deadline dates are indicated in the schedule.
