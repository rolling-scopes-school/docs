# Pair Mentoring

Pair mentoring (co-mentoring / group mentoring) is a format where **two or more mentors** join together and work with a shared group of students.

At the same time:

- in RS App **each student is still assigned to a specific "primary" mentor**;
- **Random student distribution** happens as usual — each mentor gets their own students in RS App. If needed, you can **exchange students** via
  `RS App → Interviews → Technical Screening → Transfer`  
  (or through the course coordinator).
- other mentors in the group can participate in interviews, calls, PR reviews, and general student support, **but the final score in RS APP is set by the primary mentor**.
- Pair / group mentoring is an overlay about communication, collaboration, and experience exchange. The format can be very different, the main thing is that it makes it easier and more enjoyable for all participants.
- It's not required that one of the mentors be a "senior mentor". It's normal if two mentors with comparable experience levels work together — the main thing is that you're comfortable working together.

## Why is this format needed?

Pair / group mentoring helps:

- **Support new mentors.**  
  Reduce the fear of "I don't know anything" and provide an opportunity to observe a more experienced mentor in action. Reduce uncertainty about conducting Technical screening / Interviews correctly.

- **Exchange experience.**  
  Show different styles of conducting interviews, calls, live-coding, and working with feedback. See how colleagues do code reviews and what volume of comments they give students.

- **Make mentoring more enjoyable.**  
  Mentoring together is more fun: there's someone to consult with, joke with, and share responsibility.

- **Improve the quality of student education.**  
  Students receive more attention and see different perspectives.

- **Reduce workload and risk of mentor burnout.**  
  In pair format, mentors can conduct meetings in turns, back each other up on reviews and meetings, and in case of emergencies — temporarily replace each other.

## How to find a partner?
- in the general mentor chat
- or in the RS JS/FE Pair Mentoring chat (link is in the general chat)

## How to organize the process?
### 1. Combine all students into one shared channel in Discord/Telegram;

### 2. Agree on work format

**Assignment review**

- Determine how you'll distribute PR reviews:
  - by students (each is responsible for "their own");
  - by assignments/modules;
  - in turns.
- Any mentor in the group can leave comments in PR.  
  **The score in RS App is set by the student's primary mentor**, based on reviews (including from another mentor).

**Meetings and calls**

- Decide which activities you do together:
  - a shared weekly call with all students;
  - separate calls with subgroups;
  - technical meetups / task reviews / live-coding.
- Meetings can be conducted:
  - jointly;
  - in turns ("this week A calls, next week B").

### 3. Inform students

- At the first shared call:
  - introduce both (or several) mentors;
  - explain that you're working in pair format;
  - tell who is the primary mentor for whom and how to contact whom.
- Briefly discuss:
  - how PR reviews will be organized;
  - what shared meetings are planned;

## Important Notes

- Pair mentoring is a **voluntary** practice. It's recommended but not mandatory.
- In case of serious problems or conflicts between mentors or students, don't hesitate to contact the course administrators.

Hello!  

I'll share my experience with pair mentoring.

In the current cohort, two of my mentees from the previous cohort became mentors.  
Today we have a setup call with them, during which:

- we'll create a shared channel for the current course;
- discuss questions they already have;
- agree on a mentoring plan.

Traditionally, on the main course, I conduct one call per week with my students:

- first we discuss current questions and feedback on reviews (20–30 minutes);
- then we go through several questions from the upcoming Core JS 1–2 interview
  with live coding (60–90 minutes), where students take turns solving practical
  tasks.

We conduct these calls **collectively** together with new mentors — for my and
"grand-mentees".

Until the final assignment, we keep all students together  
(at the request of the young mentor, we can immediately create an additional
separate channel for their students).

For the final assignment, an isolated channel is created for each team, and by
this time, new mentors are already ready to independently lead teams.

**Benefits for me:**  
several experts in the channel ready to answer students' questions.

**Benefits for young mentors:**  
there's someone to lean on, I'm nearby in any unclear situation.

**Benefits for students:**  

- communication in a close circle of like-minded people;
- team formation long before the final assignment;
- mentor support from several mentors at once;
- employment stories of graduates from previous cohorts "first-hand".

At the same time, in `app.rs.school`, my scenario is set up as regular individual
mentoring: each of us has our own students, and formally we cannot set
scores for assignments of each other's students — but we can help with reviews and calls.
