3. The category is created together with the cohort start.
4. Discord allows you to collapse and mute all channels from a category.
5. For each channel in the category, a channel topic is set, containing information about the channel.
6. You need to get a role for the current course in the [#role-assigner channel](https://discord.com/channels/516715744646660106/1120291411259035698/1120349319384535101), which will allow you not to miss important announcements.
