## Q&A

### How to enroll in a course in RS App?

You can enroll in upcoming courses [via this link](https://app.rs.school/registry/student).

### How to understand that I have successfully enrolled in a course?

Go to [RS App](https://app.rs.school/), check that the desired course is displayed in the course list.
Then open the Score tab. If you see your name in the first row of the table, congratulations, you have successfully enrolled in the course.

### How to understand if I can enroll in a course that has already started?

If [on the registration page](https://app.rs.school/registry/student) you can select the desired course from the course list, then you can still enroll in it.

### How can I leave a course in RS App?

To leave a course, click the "Leave course" button in [your profile](https://app.rs.school/profile). The course itself will remain in the course list, but you will no longer be able to complete assignments and track statistics.

**Attention!** Clicking this button excludes the student but leaves the possibility to rejoin the course independently by clicking the "Back to Course" button.

#### My `Total` on the Score page didn't update after taking a test, what should I do?

`Total` is updated once per day at 04:00 GMT+3
