## Types of classes
### Additional offline lectures
Offline Stream is a set of face-to-face lectures. For which we usually register up to 70 people. The quantity and material of the lecture depends on the teacher, but correlates with the material of webinars and lectures offered for self-study.
Information about additional offline classes in your city we will post in the channel #announcements
as well as at https://community-z.com/communities/the-rolling-scopes/events
Participation is welcome but not required.

### Self-study
The schedule has lectures marked as "Self-study." It is expected that you have looked/look at the recordings of these lectures. It’s more convenient to watch at a speed of 1.25+

### HTML/CSS Essentials Test
- Test format - Google form, in which you will need to enter/select the correct answers. A link to the Google form will be in the announcements chat.
- The test consists of 45 questions per 100 points.
- The test is carried out 2 times. The maximum score of two tests is taken into account.
- The test takes 24 hours.
- It is expected that before the test you will be able to watch lectures on HTML/CSS (links are in the schedule), as well as go through tasks on codeacademy

### CodeJam
This is a short task whose description is not known in advance, and a limited time is allocated for execution (from 60 minutes to 48 hours).
For example, on Monday at 21:00 everyone gets a link with a task, which takes 180 minutes to complete.

### Algorithmic tasks
- Sample assignment - https://github.com/SIARHEI-SMANTSAR/love-triangle
- Estimates for these tasks are summed up in the overall score with a coefficient from 0.1 to 0.4 (maximum you can get 40 points for solving one problem)
- We do not require solving all problems. In the last set, people who solved only 2-3 problems passed to the second stage of training.
- Schedule tasks ⇒ deductions. Think carefully before submitting someone else’s code to get 10 points.
- If during the interview you do not know how you solved the assignment you passed ⇒ there was a write-off ⇒ expulsion.
- If during the interview you know how to solve the task, but you cannot solve the obviously simpler task ⇒ there was a cancellation ⇒ expulsion.

## Commit Requirements
[Requirements for commits](git-convention.md)

## Testing Jobs
### Who is checking the tasks in stage # 1?
- Algorithmic tasks check unit tests, the score appears in RSAPP.
- Tests on git, html/css and js are checked automatically, the results are uploaded by the trainer to RSAPP, the score appears in RSAPP.
- Task codeacademy/htmlacademy is checked automatically, the score appears in RSAPP.
- Assignment tasks are checked by Cross-check, and can also be checked by a mentor during an interview in stage # 2
- Code Jam "CSS Quick Draw" is checked automatically, the results are loaded into RSAPP, the score appears in RSAPP.
- Task Git & Markdown, GIt & HTML & CSS checked automatically

## FAQ
### What should I do if I can’t get to CodeJam or pass the Test?
- Skip and try to complete the remaining tasks for the maximum score.

### Where will the link to “HTML / CSS Fundamentals Test” and “Git Fundamentals Test” be?
The school’s #announcements Discord chat channel, like all important information.

## Will it be possible to retake the algorithmic tasks
“Yes, but before the deadline.”
